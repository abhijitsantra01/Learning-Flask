🚀 Learning Flask: Building the Web, One Route at a Time
Welcome to my Flask learning journey! I'm diving into this framework because of its incredible balance between simplicity and power. Whether it's a small API or a large-scale application, Flask’s "plug-and-play" nature makes it a vital tool in any developer's kit.

🌟 Why I’m Excited
Minimalist & Flexible: I love that Flask doesn't make decisions for me. I get to choose my database, my forms, and my security tools.

Easy to Learn: The transition from pure Python to web development feels natural and intuitive.

Vast Ecosystem: Seeing how industry giants use Flask proves that "simple" can scale to "massive."
